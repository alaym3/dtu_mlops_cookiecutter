# # such that it takes a pre-trained model file and creates prediction for some data. 
# # Recommended interface is that users can give this file either a folder with raw images 
# # that gets loaded in or a numpy or pickle file with already loaded images e.g. something like this

# # python src/models/predict_model.py 
# python src/models/trained_model.pt   # file containing a pretrained model
# data/example_images.npz
